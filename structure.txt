# matrix.py
        $ Specifies the matrix class
        $ Matrix objects only have helper methods that support working with matrices (return a certain row, iterate over the matrix, get a string representation, etc)
# matrixTools.py
        $ Specifies binary operations on matrices (adding, subtracting, multiplying by scalar, dot product, vector product, etc)
        $ Specifies algorithms that work on matrices (Gaussian Elimination)
# matrixCLI.py
        $ A driver program that makes it easy to work with matrix objects.
        $ Text based. Uses a command line like structure. 
        $ Supports variables.
